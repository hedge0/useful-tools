## 1. Overview

This guide outlines a production-grade container image build pipeline that achieves SLSA (Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts) Level 3 compliance. The pipeline is cloud-agnostic and works with any container registry that supports signed images (such as AWS ECR, Google GCR/Artifact Registry, Azure ACR, and Harbor) and object storage provider (S3, GCS, Azure Blob Storage).

**Build Platform**: GitHub Actions is used throughout this guide as it is one of the few CI/CD platforms officially verified for SLSA Level 3 compliance. The ephemeral runners, isolated build environments, and tamper-evident audit logs meet SLSA's non-falsifiable provenance requirements.

### SLSA Level 3 Requirements

- **Source**: Version-controlled with verified history
- **Review**: At least one-person review recommended
- **Build**: Automated build process in ephemeral, isolated environment
- **Provenance**: Complete, unforgeable build provenance
- **Non-falsifiable**: Strong protections against tampering

## 2. Prerequisites

### Required Tools

- **[Docker Buildx](https://github.com/docker/buildx)**: Multi-platform image building with BuildKit
- **[Copacetic](https://github.com/project-copacetic/copacetic)**: Vulnerability patching tool (runs immediately after build)
- **[Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy)**: Vulnerability scanning and SBOM generation (runs after patching)

- **[Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype)**: Vulnerability scanner (alternative to Trivy)

### External Services

Cloud-agnostic service options for container registries, storage, secrets management, and logging.

| Service Category                                    | AWS                              | GCP                                          | Azure                    | Self-Hosted / Open Source                  |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Container Registry** (must support signed images) | Elastic Container Registry (ECR) | Container Registry (GCR) / Artifact Registry | Container Registry (ACR) | Harbor                                     |
| **Object Storage**                                  | S3                               | Cloud Storage (GCS)                          | Blob Storage             | MinIO or S3-compatible                     |
| **Secrets Management** (required)                   | Secrets Manager                  | Secret Manager                               | Key Vault                | HashiCorp Vault, External Secrets Operator |
| **Logging Service** (required)                      | CloudWatch Logs                  | Cloud Logging                                | Monitor                  | Splunk, ELK Stack, Loki, Fluentd           |

**Notes:**

- **Container Registry**: Must support OCI artifact storage for Cosign signatures and attestations
- **Object Storage**: Used for storing SBOMs, vulnerability scans, and SLSA provenance attestations
- **Secrets Management**: Required for registry credentials, signing keys, and storage credentials
- **Logging Service**: Essential for audit trails and compliance

### Secrets to Store in Vault

All sensitive credentials must be stored in external vault services:

- **Registry credentials**: URL, username, password/token
- **Cosign signing credentials**: Private key content, private key password
- **Object storage credentials**: Access key, secret key, bucket name, region
- **Logging service credentials**: API keys, service account credentials (if applicable)

## 3. Pipeline Stages

### Stage 1: Base Image and Application Layer Preparation

Prepare and secure application code and dependencies before building the container image. Each build runs independently in an ephemeral GitHub Actions runner with no shared state.

**Base Image**: Use [Docker Hardened Images](https://www.docker.com/products/hardened-images/) (Debian-based with dev tools, not distroless) for battle-tested stability, GNU/glibc support, and ability to install build dependencies. Free tier images require Copacetic patching (Stage 3).

**Application Security**:

- **[Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core)**: Automated dependency updates, creates PRs for outdated packages, catches vulnerabilities before build
- **[Opengrep](https://github.com/opengrep/opengrep)**: SAST for source code vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, insecure crypto, hardcoded secrets, etc.)

**Pre-Build Checklist**:

- Pin all versions (application, dependencies) - never use `latest`
- Dependabot configured and updates merged
- Opengrep scans pass (no critical/high findings)
- Application tests pass
- Code reviewed (minimum one person)
- Secrets removed (use GitHub Secret Scanning or [TruffleHog](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog))

### Stage 2: Container Image Build

Build production container image using multi-stage Dockerfile that progressively hardens the image.

**Image Naming Convention**:

- Tag format: `{registry}/{project}:{version}-{arch}`
- Include architecture in tag: `-amd64` or `-arm64`
- Examples: `registry.example.com/nginx:1.25.3-amd64`, `registry.example.com/python:3.11-arm64`
- Never use `latest` tag - always pin specific versions

**Why Explicit Architecture Tags for Private Registries:**

For production deployments, always use explicit architecture tags (`-amd64`, `-arm64`) rather than manifest lists:

**Security advantage:**

- Images are signed BEFORE push (Stage 6), eliminating unsigned window
- Manifest lists must be created AFTER pushing images, creating brief unsigned window
- **The gap exists because**: Cosign signs by digest (sha256:abc...), but the manifest digest is only calculated by the registry after push. This creates a 110-450ms window where the manifest exists unsigned in the registry, allowing an attacker with registry access to substitute it with a malicious manifest that gets signed with your legitimate key.
- Even sub-second unsigned windows are exploitable (attacker can inject malicious manifest)
- Explicit tags ensure Kubernetes always pulls signed, verified images

**Operational advantages:**

- Deployment YAML explicitly declares architecture: `image: registry.example.com/app:1.0.0-amd64`
- No ambiguity about which image gets pulled
- Easier troubleshooting (image tag matches actual architecture)
- Kyverno signature verification works on actual image, not manifest reference

**When manifest lists make sense:**

- Public registries (Docker Hub, Quay.io) where end users don't control architecture
- Multi-arch base images for local development (`docker pull nginx` auto-selects)

**For production:** Explicit architecture tags prevent the manifest unsigned window vulnerability while maintaining clear, auditable image references.

**Builder Stage**: Start with Docker Hardened Image with dev tools

- Install build dependencies
- **Go projects**: Clone from official source, compile with latest stable Go toolchain, use `CGO_ENABLED=0` for static binaries, `go mod tidy && go mod verify`, build flags `-trimpath` and `-ldflags "-s -w"`. Never use pre-compiled Go binaries.
- **Other languages**: Install language-specific build tools
- Build application binaries and run tests

**Runtime Stage**: Fresh Docker Hardened Image

- Copy compiled artifacts from builder (no build tools)
- Install minimal runtime dependencies only
- Create non-root user with minimal permissions
- Configure as default user (never run as root)

**Hardened Stage**: Attack surface reduction

- Remove package managers: `apt`, `apt-get`, `dpkg`
- Remove exclusive dependencies: Use `ldd` on binaries, trace transitive dependency chains multiple layers deep, keep only required libraries
- Optionally remove shells if not needed for runtime
- Clean up: documentation, man pages, caches, temp files
- **Result**: Immutable image that cannot install packages

**Logging**: Build started/completed, stage completions, image size

**Reproducible Builds**: Ensure builds are deterministic by pinning all versions (base image, dependencies, toolchains), stripping timestamps from build artifacts, and sorting inputs consistently. This allows independent verification that published images match source code and build configuration.

### Stage 3: Vulnerability Patching and Image Compression

**Copacetic Patching** (runs immediately after build, before scanning):

- Analyzes image package manifest, identifies patchable vulnerabilities
- Downloads and applies security patches without rebuild
- Retag patched image, remove unpatched version
- **Why first**: Reduces vulnerabilities before SBOM/scanning, ensures artifacts reflect patched state

**Image Compression** (tar export/import with metadata preservation):

1. Inspect image to extract all metadata (USER, ENV, WORKDIR, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, EXPOSE, VOLUME, STOPSIGNAL, LABEL)
2. Create temporary container (`docker create`)
3. Export filesystem to tar (`docker export`)
4. Remove temporary container and old image
5. Import tar with `--change` flags to restore all metadata
6. Clean up tar file

- **Benefits**: Single-layer image, significantly smaller, faster pulls, preserves all runtime behavior

**Logging**: Patching started/completed, vulnerabilities patched (count/severity), compression started/completed, size comparison

### Stage 4: Application Testing

Verify the patched and compressed image functions correctly before security scanning. Testing validates the build pipeline produced a working, secure image.

**Test Categories**:

- **Basic**: Binary exists, version check, help commands, startup
- **Runtime**: User ID (non-root), working directory, environment variables, permissions
- **Application-specific**: Web servers (HTTP response), databases (connections), CLI tools (commands), APIs (endpoints)
- **Dependencies**: Required libraries present (`ldd`), no missing dependencies
- **Integration**: Startup/shutdown, port binding, volumes, signal handling

**Implementation**: Create `test.sh` in repository with comprehensive, fast tests using exit codes and clear error messages.

---

**Example Test Script Structure:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e
IMAGE_NAME=$1

# Test 1: Binary functionality
VERSION=$(docker run --rm --entrypoint /path/to/binary "$IMAGE_NAME" --version)
if [[ ! "$VERSION" =~ expected_pattern ]]; then exit 1; fi

# Test 2: Non-root user verification
USER_ID=$(docker run --rm --entrypoint id "$IMAGE_NAME" -u)
if [ "$USER_ID" = "0" ]; then exit 1; fi

# Test 3: Missing library dependencies
MISSING_LIBS=$(docker run --rm "$IMAGE_NAME" sh -c 'ldd /path/to/binary 2>/dev/null | grep "not found"')
if [ -n "$MISSING_LIBS" ]; then exit 1; fi

# Test 4: Container startup and HTTP response (web services)
CONTAINER_ID=$(docker run -d -p 8080:80 "$IMAGE_NAME")
sleep 5
HTTP_CODE=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:8080/)
docker rm -f "$CONTAINER_ID"
if [ "$HTTP_CODE" != "200" ]; then exit 1; fi
```

---

**Security-Specific Tests:**

Test that security hardening is properly applied:

- **Package managers removed**: Verify `apt`, `yum`, `apk` commands fail

  ```bash
  docker run --rm "$IMAGE_NAME" sh -c "apt --version 2>&1" | grep "not found"
  ```

- **Non-root enforcement**: Verify UID is not 0 using `id -u`

  ```bash
  docker run --rm --entrypoint id "$IMAGE_NAME" -u | grep -v "^0$"
  ```

- **No secrets in environment**: Scan environment variables for patterns like `password`, `key`, `token`

  ```bash
  docker run --rm --entrypoint env "$IMAGE_NAME" | grep -iE "(password|secret|key|token)="
  ```

- **Read-only filesystem**: Test with `docker run --read-only` flag
  ```bash
  docker run --rm --read-only "$IMAGE_NAME" sh -c "touch /test"
  ```

---

**Test Frameworks by Language:**

- **Shell scripts** (recommended) - Portable, no dependencies, works with any image
- **Python pytest** - Complex validation logic, API testing with `docker-py` and `requests` libraries
- **Go testing** - Fast compiled tests with `testcontainers-go` for container lifecycle
- **Node.js Jest** - JavaScript apps with `dockerode` for Docker interaction

---

**Best Practices:**

- Exit immediately on first failure (fast-fail approach)
- Set 30-60 second timeouts per test to prevent hanging
- Include expected vs actual values in error messages
- Sequential execution is fine (15-30 tests take 2-3 minutes)

---

**Test Coverage Targets:**

| Level             | Tests Included                                | Count       | Duration |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------- | -------- |
| **Minimum**       | Basic + runtime security + dependencies       | 10-15 tests | ~1 min   |
| **Recommended**   | Above + application-specific + security tests | 20-30 tests | ~2-3 min |
| **Comprehensive** | Above + integration + performance             | 40-50 tests | ~5-8 min |

---

**Failure Handling**: Stop pipeline immediately, log failure details, preserve failed image for debugging, notify team.

**Logging**: Testing started, category completions, failures with details, total test time

### Stage 5: Security Artifacts Generation and Signing

Generate SLSA provenance, SBOMs, vulnerability scan reports, sign all artifacts, and upload to object storage.

**SLSA Provenance Attestation**:

- Generate provenance in SLSA format (meets SLSA Level 3 requirements)
- Include build parameters (repository, commit SHA, workflow, builder ID)
- Include timestamps (build start/end times)
- Include resolved dependencies (source code commit)
- Include byproducts (SBOMs, vulnerability scans)
- Save as JSON file (e.g., `attestation-{image-name}-{arch}.json`)

**SBOM Generation** (using [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy)):

- Generate in **both** CycloneDX and SPDX-JSON formats for maximum compatibility
- CycloneDX: `trivy image --format cyclonedx --output sbom-{image}-cyclonedx.json {image}`
- SPDX: `trivy image --format spdx-json --output sbom-{image}-spdx.json {image}`
- SBOMs catalog all packages, dependencies, and versions in the image

**Vulnerability Scan** (using [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy)):

- Scan patched image for remaining vulnerabilities
- Generate JSON report: `trivy image --format json --output scan-{image}.json {image}`
- Filter for HIGH and CRITICAL severities
- Report should show minimal vulnerabilities after Copacetic patching

**Signing with [Cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign)**:

- Sign each artifact using `cosign sign-blob`:
  - `cosign sign-blob --key cosign.key --output-signature {file}.sig {file}`
- Sign: SLSA attestation, both SBOMs (CycloneDX and SPDX), vulnerability scan report
- Creates `.sig` files for each artifact
- Uses private key from vault service

**Upload to Object Storage**:

- Upload all artifacts to cloud storage (S3/GCS/Azure Blob):
  - `sboms/{arch}/sbom-{image}-cyclonedx.json`
  - `sboms/{arch}/sbom-{image}-cyclonedx.json.sig`
  - `sboms/{arch}/sbom-{image}-spdx.json`
  - `sboms/{arch}/sbom-{image}-spdx.json.sig`
  - `attestations/{arch}/attestation-{image}.json`
  - `attestations/{arch}/attestation-{image}.json.sig`
  - `scans/{arch}/scan-{image}.json`
  - `scans/{arch}/scan-{image}.json.sig`
- Organize by architecture for multi-platform builds

**Logging**: SBOM generation started/completed (formats), vulnerability scan completed (findings count), attestation generated, signing completed (artifacts signed), upload completed (file count, bucket path)

### Stage 6: Image Signing and Registry Push

**Critical**: Sign the image BEFORE pushing to registry. Even fractions of a second unsigned is enough for attackers to compromise the image.

**Image Signing with [Cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign)**:

- Sign the local image with private key from vault
- Command: `cosign sign --key cosign.key {image}`
- This creates a signature that will be pushed alongside the image
- Signature is stored in the registry as an OCI artifact

**Registry Authentication**:

- Login to container registry using credentials from vault
- Authenticate before pushing to ensure proper permissions

**Push to Registry**:

- Push the signed image: `docker push {image}`
- The signature is automatically pushed with the image
- Image is now available in registry with cryptographic proof of authenticity

**Attach SLSA Attestation**:

- After push, attach the SLSA provenance attestation to the image in registry
- Command: `cosign attest --key cosign.key --predicate attestation.json --type slsaprovenance {image}`
- Attestation is stored as OCI artifact attached to the image
- Verifiers can retrieve attestation to validate build provenance

**Why This Order Matters**:

- **Sign → Push**: Image is never available unsigned in registry, eliminates window for compromise
- **Push → Attest**: Attestation requires image digest from registry, must happen after push
- Reversing this order creates security vulnerability

**Logging**: Image signing started/completed, registry authentication successful, image pushed (registry URL, digest), attestation attached, total stage time

## 4. Post-Pipeline Operations

### Continuous Vulnerability Monitoring

**Daily Scanning for New CVEs**:

- Schedule automated scans of published images in registry
- Check for newly disclosed HIGH and CRITICAL vulnerabilities with available fixes
- If patchable vulnerabilities found, trigger automated rebuild
- Copacetic patches OS-level vulnerabilities in rebuild
- Go projects automatically recompile with latest toolchain to patch vulnerabilities in Go standard library
- Push updated image to registry with new patch version tag
- Update SLSA attestation and SBOMs for new version

**Scanning Options:**

Choose between registry-based scanning or Kubernetes-native continuous scanning based on your deployment environment.

| Approach              | Deployment Location            | Real-Time Monitoring | Setup Complexity | Integration                                   | Best For                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Registry Scanning** | Container registry or cron job | No                   | Low              | Built-in registry scanners or scheduled Trivy | Simple setups, registry-focused                |
| **Trivy Operator**    | Kubernetes cluster             | Yes                  | Medium           | Native K8s custom resources, Fluentd export   | Kubernetes environments, continuous monitoring |

**Registry Scanning:**

- Scan images directly in container registry using built-in scanners (ECR/GCR/ACR/Harbor)
- Or run Trivy on a cron job to scan registry images periodically
- Generates vulnerability reports accessible via registry UI or API

**Trivy Operator:**

- Kubernetes-native continuous scanning via [Trivy Operator](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-operator)
- Automatically scans running workloads and images
- Generates vulnerability reports as Kubernetes custom resources
- Pair with [Fluentd](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd) to export scan results to external logging/monitoring systems
- Provides real-time security posture visibility

### Runtime Policy Enforcement with Kubernetes

**[Kyverno](https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno)**: Kubernetes-native policy engine for runtime security

### SLSA Provenance Verification

**Why It's Critical:**

Image signature verification only checks "was this signed?" - it doesn't verify the image was built from the correct source repository or builder. Without provenance verification, an attacker with your signing key can deploy backdoored images built from forked repos.

**Kyverno Policy with Provenance Verification:**

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: verify-slsa-provenance
spec:
  validationFailureAction: enforce
  rules:
    - name: verify-provenance
      match:
        resources:
          kinds:
            - Pod
      verifyImages:
        - imageReferences:
            - "registry.example.com/*"

          # Verify signature
          attestors:
            - entries:
                - keys:
                    publicKeys: |-
                      -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
                      ...your public key...
                      -----END PUBLIC KEY-----

          # Verify provenance claims
          attestations:
            - predicateType: https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2
              conditions:
                - all:
                    # Must be from authorized repo
                    - key: "{{ invocation.configSource.uri }}"
                      operator: Equals
                      value: "git+https://github.com/yourorg/yourapp"

                    # Must be built by GitHub Actions
                    - key: "{{ builder.id }}"
                      operator: Equals
                      value: "https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/.github/workflows/generator_container_slsa3.yml@refs/tags/v1.9.0"
```

**What Gets Verified:**

1. Image was built from authorized source repository (not attacker's fork)
2. Image was built by authorized builder (GitHub Actions, not local machine)
3. Signature is valid

**Testing:**

```bash
# Manual verification
cosign verify-attestation \
  --key cosign.pub \
  --type slsaprovenance \
  registry.example.com/app:v1.0.0
```

**Essential Policies:**

- **Image Signature Verification**: Require signed images
- **SLSA Provenance Verification**: Require authorized source repo and builder
- **Non-Root Enforcement**: Block containers running as root user
- **Resource Limits**: Enforce CPU and memory limits on all pods
- **Privileged Containers**: Block privileged mode and dangerous capabilities
- **Host Namespace Isolation**: Prevent hostNetwork, hostPID, hostIPC usage
- **Read-Only Root Filesystem**: Require read-only root filesystem where possible
- **Image Registry Allowlist**: Only allow images from approved registries

**Additional Runtime Security:**

- **[Istio](https://github.com/istio/istio)**: Service mesh for enforcing mutual TLS (mTLS) between containers, traffic management, network policies, and observability
- **[Falco](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco)**: Runtime threat detection for unusual container behavior
- **Pod Security Standards**: Enforce baseline/restricted pod security standards

## 5. Attack Scenarios Prevented

This guide's SLSA Level 3 pipeline prevents supply chain attacks targeting the software build and delivery process.

### Build-Time Security

**Build-Time Code Injection**

- Attack: Modified source code or build scripts during CI/CD execution
- Mitigated by: Ephemeral build environments (no shared state), Git commit verification, SLSA provenance tracking source commit, signed attestations

**Build Process Manipulation**

- Attack: Manipulated build flags, dependencies, or compilation to inject vulnerabilities
- Mitigated by: SLSA provenance documenting exact build parameters, reproducible builds with pinned toolchains, ephemeral environments, cryptographic attestations

**Source Code Secret Leakage**

- Attack: Hardcoded credentials, API keys, or tokens accidentally committed to source
- Mitigated by: TruffleHog secret scanning in pre-commit hooks, GitHub Secret Scanning blocking commits, SAST scanning (Opengrep), secrets in external vaults

### Dependency & Base Image Security

**Malicious Dependency Injection**

- Attack: Compromised upstream dependencies (packages, libraries) injecting malicious code
- Mitigated by: Dependabot monitoring compromised/vulnerable dependencies, SBOM generation (CycloneDX, SPDX) cataloging all dependencies, version pinning (never `latest`)

**Compromised Base Image**

- Attack: Backdoors injected into base container images used for builds
- Mitigated by: Using trusted base images (Docker Hardened Images from verified vendor), Copacetic patching after build fixing known CVEs, Trivy vulnerability scanning detecting malicious changes

**Vulnerability Deployment**

- Attack: Deploying container images with known HIGH/CRITICAL CVEs to production
- Mitigated by: Copacetic patching during build, Trivy scanning blocking critical unfixed CVEs, Go projects recompiled with latest toolchain, Trivy Operator post-deployment scanning

### Registry & Artifact Security

**Registry Poisoning**

- Attack: Malicious images pushed to registry impersonating legitimate builds
- Mitigated by: Registry authentication required for push/pull, Cosign signing BEFORE registry push (no unsigned window), Kyverno signature verification, SLSA attestation proving authentic build, private signing keys in vault

**Unsigned Artifact Tampering**

- Attack: Modified SBOMs, vulnerability reports, or attestations after generation
- Mitigated by: All artifacts signed with Cosign, signatures verified before trusting, artifacts in object storage (S3/GCS) with versioning/access controls, immutable artifact chain

**Compromised Container Registry**

- Attack: Registry access gained to modify or replace images
- Mitigated by: Kyverno + Cosign image signature verification, SLSA attestation verification matching build provenance, registry access controls and audit logging, immutable image tags

### Runtime Vulnerability Management

**Runtime Package Manager Abuse**

- Attack: Attackers use package managers (apt, yum, apk) in compromised containers to install malicious tools
- Mitigated by: Hardened stage in Dockerfile removes all package managers, non-root user preventing installations, immutable read-only root filesystem where possible

**Unpatched Runtime Vulnerabilities**

- Attack: New CVEs disclosed after image deployment creating exploitable vulnerabilities
- Mitigated by: Daily automated scanning of published images, automated rebuilds when patchable vulnerabilities found, Copacetic re-patching in rebuild, GitOps deployment via ArgoCD
