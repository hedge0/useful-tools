## 1. Overview

This guide outlines production-ready patterns for securing object storage (S3, GCS, Azure Blob Storage) for backups, user uploads, compliance data, and data lakes. Misconfigured object storage is one of the most common causes of data breaches in cloud environments.

**Common Use Cases:**

- Database backups and disaster recovery
- User file uploads (documents, images, videos)
- Application logs and audit trails
- Data lakes for analytics
- Static website hosting
- CI/CD artifact storage

**Real-World Breaches:**

- **Capital One (2019)**: 100M+ customer records exposed via misconfigured S3 bucket
- **Accenture**: 137GB of private data exposed in publicly accessible S3 bucket
- **Verizon**: 14M customer records exposed via S3 misconfiguration

**Core Principles:**

- **Default Deny**: Block public access by default, allow explicitly when needed
- **Least Privilege**: Grant minimum required permissions
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers (IAM, bucket policies, encryption, logging)
- **Encryption Everywhere**: At-rest and in-transit
- **Audit Everything**: Log all access for compliance and threat detection

## 2. Prerequisites

### Required Tools

- **AWS CLI**: For S3 management
- **gcloud CLI**: For GCS management
- **Azure CLI**: For Azure Blob Storage management

### External Services

Cloud-agnostic service options for object storage, key management, and logging.

| Service Category              | AWS                     | GCP                 | Azure                |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Object Storage** (required) | S3                      | Cloud Storage (GCS) | Blob Storage         |
| **Key Management** (required) | KMS                     | Cloud KMS           | Key Vault            |
| **Logging & SIEM** (required) | CloudTrail, CloudWatch  | Cloud Logging       | Monitor              |
| **Cold Storage** (compliance) | S3 Glacier Deep Archive | Archive Storage     | Archive Blob Storage |

## 3. Access Control

Access control is the most critical aspect of object storage security. Misconfigured permissions are the #1 cause of data breaches.

### Bucket Policies vs IAM Policies

**Use IAM Policies When:**

- Controlling what actions a user/service can perform across multiple buckets
- Managing permissions for internal users and services
- Example: "This Lambda function can read from any bucket in the account"

**Use Bucket Policies When:**

- Controlling access to a specific bucket from multiple sources
- Granting cross-account access
- Enforcing encryption requirements on uploads
- Example: "Only these accounts can access this specific bucket"

**AWS S3 Example - Bucket Policy (Deny Public Access):**

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "DenyPublicRead",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-private-bucket/*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringNotEquals": {
          "aws:PrincipalAccount": "123456789012"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Best Practice:** Use both IAM policies (for users/services) and bucket policies (for bucket-specific rules) together.

### Public Access Blocks (CRITICAL)

**Always enable public access blocks** to prevent accidental exposure.

**AWS S3 - Enable Public Access Block:**

```bash
aws s3api put-public-access-block \
  --bucket my-private-bucket \
  --public-access-block-configuration \
    "BlockPublicAcls=true,IgnorePublicAcls=true,BlockPublicPolicy=true,RestrictPublicBuckets=true"
```

**GCP Cloud Storage - Uniform Bucket-Level Access:**

```bash
gcloud storage buckets update gs://my-bucket --uniform-bucket-level-access
```

**Azure Blob Storage - Disable Public Access:**

```bash
az storage account update \
  --name mystorageaccount \
  --resource-group myresourcegroup \
  --allow-blob-public-access false
```

**What Public Access Block Prevents:**

- Accidental public ACLs on objects
- Bucket policies that grant public access
- Anonymous public access to buckets

**When to Allow Public Access:**

- Static website hosting (use CloudFront/CDN with origin access control instead)
- Public datasets (carefully configure with specific public prefixes only)

### Pre-Signed URLs for Temporary Access

Use pre-signed URLs to grant temporary access to private objects without changing bucket permissions.

**AWS S3 - Generate Pre-Signed URL (Python):**

```python
import boto3
from datetime import timedelta

s3_client = boto3.client('s3')

# Generate URL valid for 1 hour
url = s3_client.generate_presigned_url(
    'get_object',
    Params={
        'Bucket': 'my-private-bucket',
        'Key': 'user-uploads/document.pdf'
    },
    ExpiresIn=3600  # 1 hour
)
```

**GCP Cloud Storage - Signed URL:**

```python
from google.cloud import storage
from datetime import timedelta

client = storage.Client()
bucket = client.bucket('my-bucket')
blob = bucket.blob('document.pdf')

url = blob.generate_signed_url(
    version='v4',
    expiration=timedelta(hours=1),
    method='GET'
)
```

**Use Cases:**

- User file downloads (documents, images)
- File uploads from client applications
- Temporary access for external partners
- Avoiding credentials in client-side code

**Security Notes:**

- Keep expiration times short (minutes to hours, not days)
- URLs are bearer tokens - anyone with the URL has access
- Consider IP restrictions for sensitive data

**DNS and Subdomain Takeover Prevention:**

When using custom domains (CNAMEs) pointing to object storage, coordinate bucket lifecycle with DNS carefully to prevent subdomain takeover attacks.

**The vulnerability:** If you delete a bucket while DNS still points to it, an attacker can register the same bucket name (now available) and serve malicious content on your domain.

```bash
# Vulnerable sequence:
# 1. You have: assets.example.com → CNAME → company-assets.s3.amazonaws.com
# 2. You delete bucket: company-assets
# 3. DNS still has: assets.example.com → CNAME → company-assets.s3.amazonaws.com
# 4. Attacker registers: company-assets bucket
# 5. Attacker now serves content on your domain with your SSL cert
```

**Prevention strategies:**

- Before deleting buckets, scan DNS zones for references (automated check in IaC teardown)
- Use CloudFront with Origin Access Control (OAC) instead of direct S3 CNAMEs - point DNS at CloudFront distributions you control
- Maintain bucket name inventory with associated DNS records
- Implement "bucket parking" - keep critical bucket names registered but empty/minimal config ($0.001/month storage cost to prevent $millions in reputational damage)

**CloudFront OAC pattern (recommended):**

```bash
# Point DNS at CloudFront (you control), not S3 bucket (can be reclaimed)
assets.example.com → CNAME → d123456abcdef.cloudfront.net

# CloudFront origin points to S3
# If S3 bucket deleted, CloudFront returns controlled error, not attacker content
```

### VPC Endpoints for Private Access

Use VPC endpoints to access object storage privately without traversing the internet.

**AWS S3 - VPC Endpoint:**

```bash
aws ec2 create-vpc-endpoint \
  --vpc-id vpc-12345678 \
  --service-name com.amazonaws.us-east-1.s3 \
  --route-table-ids rtb-12345678
```

**Then restrict bucket access to VPC endpoint:**

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket", "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"],
      "Condition": {
        "StringNotEquals": {
          "aws:SourceVpce": "vpce-1a2b3c4d"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**GCP Cloud Storage - Private Service Connect:**

```bash
gcloud compute addresses create my-psc-address \
  --global \
  --purpose=PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT \
  --addresses=10.0.0.5 \
  --network=my-vpc
```

**Benefits:**

- Traffic never leaves cloud provider's network
- Reduced data transfer costs
- Better security (no internet exposure)

### Cross-Account Access

Grant access to buckets from other AWS accounts, GCP projects, or Azure subscriptions using bucket policies. Use specific IAM roles (not account root), grant least privilege, require MFA for sensitive operations, and log all cross-account access.

## 4. Encryption

Encrypt all data at rest and in transit. Most cloud providers encrypt by default, but you should verify and configure appropriately.

### Server-Side Encryption

**Encryption Options:**

**SSE-S3 / SSE-GCS (Managed Keys):**

- Cloud provider manages encryption keys
- Simplest option, enabled by default
- Good for most use cases

**SSE-KMS / CMEK (Customer Master Keys):**

- You control key rotation and access policies
- Audit key usage in CloudTrail/Cloud Logging
- Required for compliance (HIPAA, PCI-DSS)

**SSE-C / CSEK (Customer-Provided Keys):**

- You provide encryption key with each request
- You manage key storage and rotation
- Rare use case (extreme control requirements)

**AWS S3 - Enable Default Encryption (KMS):**

```bash
aws s3api put-bucket-encryption \
  --bucket my-bucket \
  --server-side-encryption-configuration '{
    "Rules": [{
      "ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault": {
        "SSEAlgorithm": "aws:kms",
        "KMSMasterKeyID": "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012"
      },
      "BucketKeyEnabled": true
    }]
  }'
```

**When to Use Each:**

- **SSE-S3/SSE-GCS**: Default for most buckets
- **SSE-KMS/CMEK**: Compliance requirements, audit trails, PHI/PII data
- **SSE-C/CSEK**: Extreme security requirements (rare)

### Encryption in Transit

Always use HTTPS/TLS for object storage access.

**Enforce HTTPS Only (AWS S3):**

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket", "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"],
      "Condition": {
        "Bool": {
          "aws:SecureTransport": "false"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Best Practices:**

- Always use HTTPS endpoints (`https://s3.amazonaws.com`, not `http://`)
- Enforce TLS 1.2 or higher
- Deny non-HTTPS access via bucket policy

### Key Rotation

Rotate encryption keys regularly for compliance.

**AWS KMS - Enable Automatic Key Rotation:**

```bash
aws kms enable-key-rotation --key-id 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
```

This rotates keys automatically every year. Old versions remain available for decryption.

**GCP Cloud KMS - Manual Rotation:**

```bash
# Create new key version
gcloud kms keys versions create \
  --location=us \
  --keyring=my-keyring \
  --key=my-key \
  --primary

# New encryptions use new version, old data still decryptable
```

**Rotation Frequency:**

- **Automated rotation**: Annually (AWS KMS default)
- **Manual rotation**: Quarterly or after security incidents
- **Compliance requirements**: Follow HIPAA (annually), PCI-DSS (annually)

## 5. Versioning & Data Protection

### Versioning

Enable versioning to protect against accidental deletion and ransomware.

**AWS S3 - Enable Versioning:**

```bash
aws s3api put-bucket-versioning \
  --bucket my-bucket \
  --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled
```

**GCP Cloud Storage - Enable Versioning:**

```bash
gcloud storage buckets update gs://my-bucket --versioning
```

**How Versioning Works:**

- Every object modification creates a new version
- Delete operations create a delete marker (object recoverable)
- Old versions remain until explicitly deleted
- Cost: You pay for storage of all versions

**Use Cases:**

- Accidental deletion recovery
- Ransomware protection (restore previous versions)
- Compliance (maintain history of changes)

### Object Lock (WORM)

Object Lock provides Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM) protection for compliance.

**AWS S3 - Enable Object Lock:**

```bash
# Must enable on bucket creation
aws s3api create-bucket \
  --bucket my-compliance-bucket \
  --region us-east-1 \
  --object-lock-enabled-for-bucket

# Set default retention
aws s3api put-object-lock-configuration \
  --bucket my-compliance-bucket \
  --object-lock-configuration '{
    "ObjectLockEnabled": "Enabled",
    "Rule": {
      "DefaultRetention": {
        "Mode": "COMPLIANCE",
        "Years": 7
      }
    }
  }'
```

**Retention Modes:**

**COMPLIANCE Mode:**

- No one can delete or modify (not even root user)
- Cannot shorten retention period
- Use for: Regulatory compliance (SEC, FINRA, HIPAA)

**GOVERNANCE Mode:**

- Users with special permissions can delete
- Retention period can be shortened
- Use for: Internal policies, testing

**Legal Hold:**

- Indefinite retention until removed
- Independent of retention period
- Use for: Litigation, investigations

**Use Cases:**

- Financial records (7-year retention)
- Healthcare records (HIPAA requirements)
- Audit logs (SOC2, PCI-DSS)

### MFA Delete

Require multi-factor authentication to delete objects or disable versioning.

**AWS S3 - Enable MFA Delete:**

```bash
# Must be done by root account with MFA
aws s3api put-bucket-versioning \
  --bucket my-bucket \
  --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled,MFADelete=Enabled \
  --mfa "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/root-account-mfa-device 123456"
```

**Benefits:**

- Prevents accidental deletion by compromised credentials
- Additional layer of protection for critical data
- Compliance requirement for some regulations

## 6. Lifecycle Management & Compliance

### Storage Classes

Different storage classes optimize cost for different access patterns.

**AWS S3 Storage Classes:**

| Class               | Access Pattern             | Cost (relative) | Retrieval Time |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| S3 Standard         | Frequent access            | High            | Instant        |
| S3 Intelligent-Tier | Unknown/changing access    | Auto-optimized  | Instant        |
| S3 Standard-IA      | Infrequent access          | Medium          | Instant        |
| S3 Glacier Instant  | Archive, instant retrieval | Low             | Instant        |
| S3 Glacier Flexible | Archive, rare retrieval    | Very Low        | Minutes-hours  |
| S3 Glacier Deep     | Long-term archive          | Lowest          | 12 hours       |

**GCP Cloud Storage Classes:**

| Class    | Access Pattern              | Cost (relative) |
| -------- | --------------------------- | --------------- |
| Standard | Frequent access             | High            |
| Nearline | Infrequent (once/month)     | Medium          |
| Coldline | Rare (once/quarter)         | Low             |
| Archive  | Long-term archive (once/yr) | Lowest          |

### Lifecycle Policies

Automatically transition objects to cheaper storage classes over time.

**AWS S3 - Lifecycle Policy:**

```json
{
  "Rules": [
    {
      "Id": "Archive old logs",
      "Status": "Enabled",
      "Filter": {
        "Prefix": "logs/"
      },
      "Transitions": [
        {
          "Days": 30,
          "StorageClass": "STANDARD_IA"
        },
        {
          "Days": 90,
          "StorageClass": "GLACIER_IR"
        },
        {
          "Days": 365,
          "StorageClass": "DEEP_ARCHIVE"
        }
      ],
      "Expiration": {
        "Days": 2555
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**GCP Cloud Storage - Lifecycle Configuration:**

```json
{
  "lifecycle": {
    "rule": [
      {
        "action": {
          "type": "SetStorageClass",
          "storageClass": "NEARLINE"
        },
        "condition": {
          "age": 30,
          "matchesPrefix": ["logs/"]
        }
      },
      {
        "action": {
          "type": "Delete"
        },
        "condition": {
          "age": 2555,
          "matchesPrefix": ["logs/"]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Common Patterns:**

- **Active data**: Standard (0-30 days)
- **Recent backups**: Standard-IA (30-90 days)
- **Old backups**: Glacier (90-365 days)
- **Compliance archives**: Deep Archive (1+ years)
- **Log retention**: Transition to archive, delete after 7 years

### Compliance Requirements

**GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation):**

- Right to deletion (delete user data on request)
- Data residency (store data in specific regions)
- Breach notification (72 hours)
- Use versioning + object lock for audit trails

**HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act):**

- Encrypt all PHI (SSE-KMS/CMEK required)
- Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with cloud provider
- Access logging and audit trails
- 6-year retention for medical records

**PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard):**

- Encrypt cardholder data (SSE-KMS/CMEK)
- Restrict access (principle of least privilege)
- Log all access to cardholder data
- Quarterly key rotation

**SOC2 (System and Organization Controls):**

- Access controls and logging
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Regular access reviews
- Incident response procedures

## 7. Audit Logging & Monitoring

### Server Access Logs

Enable access logs to track all requests to your buckets.

**AWS S3 - Enable Server Access Logging:**

```bash
aws s3api put-bucket-logging \
  --bucket my-bucket \
  --bucket-logging-status '{
    "LoggingEnabled": {
      "TargetBucket": "my-logs-bucket",
      "TargetPrefix": "s3-access-logs/"
    }
  }'
```

**GCP Cloud Storage - Enable Access Logs:**

```bash
gcloud storage buckets update gs://my-bucket \
  --log-bucket=gs://my-logs-bucket \
  --log-object-prefix=gcs-logs/
```

**What Gets Logged:**

- Requester account/IP address
- Bucket and object key
- Request type (GET, PUT, DELETE)
- Response status code
- Error codes
- Bytes sent
- Request/response time

### Object-Level Logging

Enable CloudTrail (AWS) or Cloud Logging (GCP) for detailed API-level logging.

**AWS S3 - CloudTrail Data Events:**

```bash
aws cloudtrail put-event-selectors \
  --trail-name my-trail \
  --event-selectors '[{
    "ReadWriteType": "All",
    "IncludeManagementEvents": true,
    "DataResources": [{
      "Type": "AWS::S3::Object",
      "Values": ["arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"]
    }]
  }]'
```

**What CloudTrail Logs:**

- GetObject, PutObject, DeleteObject operations
- IAM principal (who made the request)
- Source IP address
- Request parameters
- Response elements

**Cost Note:** Object-level logging can be expensive for high-traffic buckets. Consider enabling only for sensitive buckets.

### Alerting

Set up alerts for suspicious activity.

**AWS CloudWatch Alarm - Detect Public Bucket:**

```bash
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm \
  --alarm-name s3-public-access-detected \
  --alarm-description "Alert on S3 bucket made public" \
  --metric-name PublicAccessBlockConfiguration \
  --namespace AWS/S3 \
  --statistic Average \
  --period 300 \
  --evaluation-periods 1 \
  --threshold 0 \
  --comparison-operator LessThanThreshold \
  --alarm-actions arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:security-alerts
```

**Key Alerts to Configure:**

- Bucket policy changes (especially public access grants)
- Object deletions in versioned buckets
- Failed authentication attempts
- Access from unexpected IP addresses/regions
- Large data downloads (potential exfiltration)

## 8. Attack Scenarios Prevented

This guide's security controls prevent real-world object storage attacks commonly seen in production environments.

**Public Bucket Exposure**

- Attack: Misconfigured bucket permissions expose sensitive data publicly
- Mitigated by: Public access blocks enabled by default, bucket policies with explicit deny, regular access reviews, CloudTrail logging

**Ransomware / Malicious Deletion**

- Attack: Attacker deletes or encrypts objects, demands ransom for recovery
- Mitigated by: Versioning enabled (recover previous versions), Object Lock (WORM prevents deletion), MFA delete (requires 2FA), cross-region replication

**Data Exfiltration**

- Attack: Compromised credentials used to download large amounts of sensitive data
- Mitigated by: VPC endpoints (private network access), CloudTrail logging (detect unusual downloads), alerts on large data transfers, least privilege IAM policies

**Subdomain Takeover via Object Storage**

- Attack: Attacker claims abandoned bucket name, serves malicious content on your domain
- Mitigated by: Never delete buckets with DNS records pointing to them, use CloudFront with origin access control, maintain bucket name inventory

**Credential Leakage**

- Attack: Access keys leaked in GitHub, logs, or client-side code
- Mitigated by: Use IAM roles instead of access keys, pre-signed URLs for temporary access, secret scanning (TruffleHog), rotate keys regularly
